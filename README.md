# Hi there 👋

I'm Emmanuel, a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that make real-world impact. I’ve worked across a variety of domains including computer vision, generative AI, and ML infrastructure. I'm particularly excited about deploying models at scale, fine-tuning LLMs, and developing AI-powered products end-to-end.

I'm always learning 🌱 and love to explore new tools and techniques in the AI space.
